a. 4 12
b. 4 4
c. 2 6
d. 4 6
e. AttributeError: 'Thing' object has no attribute 'getit'.
Consider the following code:

Part B: Short Answer Questions
Marks for questions in this section are shown in brackets.
Please answer all of the following questions in the exam answer booklet.
[2 marks] Write the results of evaluating each of the following individual expressions:

b. 1 + 23 // 4
c. 0 > 0 and 1 < 3
d. 9 != 9 or 8 <= 8

[2 marks] Write the best names you can for each of the following parts of a class that
represents a “sports team”:
a. the module (file) name
b. the class name
c. a function that sets the team's salary cap
d. an attribute variable that represents if the team member is playing
[2 marks] Write the output of the following program:
text = "O when THE Saints"
parts = text.lower().split()
for i, part in enumerate(sorted(parts)):
 print(part, i)
[3 marks] Write a Building class that can represent a building and store the
attributes, name (string) and maximum_occupancy (integer), which can be passed
in when a new object is made.
Write a method called will_fit(number) that returns True if the building can fit the
passed-in number (of people), False otherwise.
Example: The following client code would create a building object and set result to
False.
b = Building("Innovation Complex", 1200)
result = b.will_fit(1201) # result would be False
[2 marks] Given a string variable called string, write code to print the letters in the
string backwards.
string = "CP1404 is good"
would print "doog si 4041PC"
[3 marks] Write the definition for a function called create_dictionary that takes
two parameters: a list of keys and a list of values, which will be the same length.
The function should return a dictionary where the keys are the keys from the first
parameter and the values are from the second. Example of this in action:
For the following code:
calories = [75, 65, 6175]
food = ["Egg", "Apple", "Carrot Cake"]
print(create_dictionary(food, calories))
the output would be:
{'Carrot Cake': 6175, 'Egg': 75, 'Apple': 65}
